					In this modern digital age, those who expose corruption, fight racism, and fight for justice and democracy face increasing threats and persecution online.

				<h2>Are you an activist, journalist, or human rights defender?</h2>
				<p>
					Security Without Borders is here to help. We can assist with web security assessments, conduct breach investigations and analysis, and generally act as an advisor in questions pertaining to cyber security. As security services are often expensive to come by, SWB offers these services free to organizations and people fighting against human rights abuse, racism, and other injustices.
