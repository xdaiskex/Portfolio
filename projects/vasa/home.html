As part of our FAA funded program, we are making space sensors for detecting gas/fuel/oxidizer leaks and monitoring crew cabin air quality for commercial space vehicles. The sensor was flown at 122, 000 ft using NASA's high-altitude balloons. Here are some pictures:

                    Vasu Lab's LED-based CO and CO2 sensors for space crafts brought very interesting creativity from Prof. Kevin Haran's advanced drawing class. Below are pictures from the art exhibition event held today. Prof. Vasu and Zachary Loparo along with Prof. Kevin Haran and his students.

                    One of the objectives of ICubed is to inform the UCF Community about scientific and engineering concepts. The project is accomplishing this objective by funding the STEAM Gallery which is an activity that encourages STEM faculty and their students to collaborate with Art and Design faculty and their students to create STEM inspired artifacts (sculptures, paintings, illustrations, and posters).
